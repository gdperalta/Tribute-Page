                    <h1>Who is Elon Musk?</h1>
                    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
                    <p>Elon Musk was born and raised in South Africa. He spent some time in Canada and enrolled in Queen's University in Kingston Ontario where he met Justine Wilson. They got married and had five sons together before divorcing in 2008.</p>
                    <p>After two years at Queen's University, Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Physics, as well as a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the Wharton School. </p>
                    <h2>Notable Accomplishments</h2>
                    <p>Educated at the University of Pennsylvania in physics, Musk started getting his feet wet as a serial tech entrepreneur with early successes like Zip2 and X.com.</p>
                    <h3>Tesla</h3>
                    <p>Under his watch, Tesla has become one of the world’s most popular and coveted car brands.</p>
                    <p>In addition to producing electric vehicles, Tesla maintains a robust presence in the solar energy space, thanks to its acquisition of SolarCity.</p>
                    <h3>SpaceX</h3>
                    <p>Musk used much of the proceeds of his PayPal sale to found Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, commonly known as SpaceX, an interstellar travel company.</p>
                    <p>With SpaceX, Musk landed several high-profile contracts with NASA and the U.S. Air Force to design rockets and conduct military missions. Musk has been vocal about his plans to send an astronaut to Mars by 2025 in a collaborative effort with NASA.</p>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Musk’s early interests in philosophy, science fiction, and fantasy novels are reflected in his sense of idealism and concern with human progress—and in his business career.</p>
                    <p>He works in the areas that he has identified as crucial to our future, specifically the Internet, the transition to renewable energy sources, and space colonization.</p>
                    <p>He has defied critics, disrupted industries, and made advances in all three of these frontiers, via his creation of PayPal, Tesla Motors, SolarCity, and SpaceX—game-changers all, despite their sometimes rocky performance.</p>
